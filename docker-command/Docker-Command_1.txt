Command to build your app to docker engine
> docker build .
> (.) or dot we tell the docker that the dockerfile will be the same folder as we running this command.

Run your app depends on the port of your config in the system
"Docker run"- Creates new docker container, once running or created a container no need to use again because it was created docker before.


> docker run -p 3000:3000 1ceab10a5b49
>  docker run -p <port that you can access to your local>:<port in your image> <image>
> docker run -p 3000:3000 -d 1ceab10a5b49 - "-d" detach you when the container run.


Stop the app in docker engine.
> docker stop <container names>
> ex:docker stop cool_nightingale

Check the list of container running in docker engine
> docker ps

Images
 > Templates/blueprints for containers
 > contains code + required tools
 > we can define it once, but run it multiple times on different machines and different servers,And the image is that sharable package
with all the setup instructions and all the code.And the container will be concrete running instance off such an image.

Install application by using url: https://hub.docker.com/_/node
> Docker run <application name>
> ex: docker run node

Display all containers
> docker ps -a
> Status:Exited means not running anymore

-Word "-it" Expose an interactive session from inside the container to our hosting machine.Or you can access the application inside the container.
> docker run -it node
> Docker run -it <application name>

===============================================
SAMPLE IMAGE BELOW
===============================================

FROM node 
# node - image that existing in docker hub

logs = command to show the activity in your command.
-f  = follow log output , to display future log
> docker logs de89999c86c9 -f

To allow you to run your application using cmd command, Without running your application using port
-i = interactive
-t = Allocate a pseudo-TTY
> docker run -it <image id>
OR
